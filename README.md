Google ranks its sites primarily by relevance to the key word. However, it recently began including  mobile page load speed as a factor in their algorithm. The article explains how Google understands speed and notes that by optimizing for speed you will improve the UX of your site and you could be increasing your rankings as well. 

In order to understand speed, Google uses CrUX metrics:
* First Paint: When anything loads on your screen.
* First Contentful Paint: When text or images load on screen.
* Dom Loaded Content: When the DOM is fully loaded.
* Onload: When any additional scripts have loaded.
* First Input Delay: The time between a user interaction and a response from the server.

The article recommends pulling CrUX metrics for your site and what steps you can take to optimize. This public data can be pulled on any website to compare how youâ€™re doing against your competitors.
